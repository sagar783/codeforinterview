The Problem

Write a function that takes two parameters n and k and returns the value of Binomial Coefficient C(n, k).
For example, your function should return 6 for n = 4 and k = 2, and it should return 10 for n = 5 and k = 2.

Solution ->
I have use recursive program here, the main idea is whether a element is there in the selected element or it is not there
