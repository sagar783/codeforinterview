The Problem

Write a function that takes two parameters n and k and returns the value of Binomial Coefficient C(n, k).
For example, your function should return 6 for n = 4 and k = 2, and it should return 10 for n = 5 and k = 2.

Solution 1 ->
I have used recursive program here, the main idea is whether a element is there in the selected element or it is not there

Solution 2 ->
We can create an 2d array of n*n and can use memoization to store the value, this would be an top down approch

Solution 3 ->

we can use bottom's up approch, we  can create pascal's triagle to find the Solution
